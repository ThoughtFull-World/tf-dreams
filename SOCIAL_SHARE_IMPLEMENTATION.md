## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Download Failed"
**Cause:** Video URL not accessible or CORS issue  
**Solution:** Ensure video URL has proper CORS headers and is publicly accessible

### "Share Sheet Doesn't Show Instagram/TikTok"
**Cause:** Apps not installed or browser doesn't support file sharing  
**Solution:** This is expected - fallback will activate automatically

### "Deep Link Doesn't Open App"
**Cause:** App not installed or iOS/Android restrictions  
**Solution:** Browser will open web version after 1 second timeout

### "Video Not Playing After Share"
**Cause:** Video format not supported by platform  
**Solution:** Ensure videos are in MP4/H.264 format (most compatible)
